urnie.js - A persistant random non-repeating picker
Jack A Perkins, 2011 - released under GPLv2
Inspired by Max/MSP's [urn] object

Create a new Urn() and then call urn.grab(['some','array','here'])
to be given a random member of the array. Urn removes the item from
an internal list so that future calls to grab will not pick it again
until all other items have been grabbed and the urn has been refreshed.

Urn is keyed with the value of the array that is passed in, an urn can
therefor manage memebers for any number of unique arrays. Remember that
urn keeps a reference of the array as a key, so you must call remove(key)
if you wish to allow garbage collection to clean up.

!! Use urns on STATIC arrays or take Great caution !!
Changing the members in your array inbetween calls to grab will produce
different results than you may be expecting as JS treats each array
as a different key. Check out the demo.html for an example.

Urn currently doesn't have a feature to prevent repeating elements between
the last and first calls of seperate replenishments.
